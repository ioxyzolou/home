                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our goal this week was to print and assemble an E-nable Phoenix hand. This mechanical hand prosthesis can be modified and adjusted to the needs of different users, and intends to make prosthetics more accessible for children who grow very quickly and thus need to have assistive devices frequently modified.</p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Printing</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">To start off this project, we set up our print and settings. We printed the parts to build the hand using a Raise3D printer. Pictured below is the sliced version of all the parts of the hand. At least two printers had to be used in order to print everything, and the print took several days.</p>

                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 4/palm-print.png" alt="Benchy Design Sketches" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The print settings used were standard, the only difference is that we printed the design at a 150% scale and a 5 mm raft was added in order to create support for some of the finer details on smaller parts of the hand.</p>

                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 4/raft-settings.png" alt="Benchy Design Sketches" /></figure>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Assembling the Hand</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In order to assemble the E-nable Phoenix Hand, I used a combination of a video tutorial and a written manual. E-nable provides a written instruction manual in the format of a presentation. This was the first set of instructions I used, before I realized that they were very outdated and were catered to an older version of the E-nable hand.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I then pivoted to using the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXoVSTgzyec. The instructions in the video were much more clear and concise as I was able to directly follow along with the woman building it. I would say, considering how large the E-nable community is, that there is plenty of helpful documentation out there on how to build the hand, with a video format being the most engaging type.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Overall the process of building it was not incredibly difficult, and I actually found it quite fun. What helped me the most was ensuring that I had properly organized all of my parts before beginning to build.</p>

                            <img class="mb-4" width="600" src="assets/project 4/organized.png" alt=“…”>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">One issue that I encountered was that I put too much raft on the palm piece, and it was difficult to remove. I eventually solved this by using a metal scraper.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="600" src="assets/project 4/raft.png" alt=“…”>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="600" src="assets/project 4/no-raft.png" alt=“…”>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Beyond that, I did not experience any other major issues with building this prosthetic hand, a positive indication of just how accessible it is. Within just one class period, I was able to build the whole E-nable Phoenix Hand. The process was particularly rewarding knowing I had created a functional prosthetic in such a streamlined manner.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="600" src="assets/project 4/final.png" alt=“…”>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The hand could even grab stuff!</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="600" src="assets/project 4/coffee.png" alt=“…”>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Modifications</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">With its accessible open-source design and large online community, the E-nable hand has significant potential. Modifications can be added and tested to the ready-made design to improve it. One such idea for improvement that I had was the addition of a pencil/art tool holder. This would allow the user to have a better grip on a writing tool. A sketch of the prototype is pictured below.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="600" src="assets/project 4/sketch.png" alt=“…”>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The holder would be made out of a flexible but sturdy material, such as ninja flex, so that various sizes of tools could be interchanged. I imagine that it would have a snap-in mechanism to attach to a point between the pointer finger and the thumb on the E-nable hand. Additionally, it would bend at various controlled angles, allowing for versatile use and creativity. I even imagine that a more detailed accessible art kit could accompany such an accessory. For example, creating various attachments catered towards different art tools including but not limited to pens, pencils, markers, and brushes.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I believe that there is a lot of potential with an accessible product like the E-nable Phoenix Hand to further develop and be personalized to clients depending on their needs and interests.</p>
