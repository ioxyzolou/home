                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Goals for our Design</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After being unable to secure a client for our final project, our group began prototyping with the intention of creating an open source guide. In the previous assignment, project 6, we considered the needs of a turtle by going through the IBM Enterprise Design Thinking Process. The consensus was the following:</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">A turtle needs to have a secure shell so that it can comfortably perform everyday actions safely.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 7/diagram.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We kept this need in mind as we navigated the best structure and material for a turtle shell. Looking back at our diagram, there were 3 key features that needed to be addressed: Safety, Agility/Comfort, and Social Interaction. We wanted for our design to provide a secure, comfortable solution for a turtle, as well as provide the option to play with aesthetics.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Iterations</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For our iteration process, we developed a streamlined force testing protocol for all the prototypes of turtle shells that we printed.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">Test 1: Static Force</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">- Add light weights</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">- Step on shell</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Jump on shell</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"></p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">Test 2: Free Fall</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">- Drop down one flight of stairs</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">- Drop all the way down stairwell</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"></p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">Test 3: Buoyancy (only for sea turtle)</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">- Float in water</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">- Submerge underwater and release</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">1. The Eastern Box Turtle Shell</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For our first iteration, we printed two Eastern Box Turtle Shells in PLA. These were both printed on the Raise3D E2 printers with 15% infill and supports. We used one shell to perform the force and drop tests. Adding static force to the shell did not particularly damage it, but dropping it down the stairs started chipping layers off. When we dropped the shell all the way down the Abelson stairwell, it split in half and parts of the bottom had chipped off.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="300" src="assets/project 7/broken.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our teammate Dean then had the idea to use a heat gun to create a plastic mold of the shell. This was to serve as a structure for our reconstruction and also simulate the turtle’s vertebrae and skeleton. What we were going to repair was the carapace, the outermost part of the shell which is what protects the turtle’s vertebrae and ribs. The plastic mold that we created simulated the turtle’s skeleton.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="300" src="assets/project 7/plastic.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The other print that we kept intact, we drilled holes into just to see how difficult it was to break through the material.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="300" src="assets/project 7/drilled.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">2. Tortoise</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We printed a tortoise in nylon to test how a shell interacts with the rest of a turtle’s body. It held up well through test 1, but some of its legs popped off after being dropped down the stairs in test 2. The shell remained intact though, which was a good indication of a 3D printed shell’s integrity when attached to the rest of a turtle’s body.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="300" src="assets/project 7/tortoise.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">3. Sea Turtle Shell</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For our next iteration, we pivoted to printing a sea turtle shell, once again out of nylon. This was printed with a Raise-3D E2 printer. This is when we incorporated the buoyancy test in order to see how a 3D printed shell might respond to water, as strong swimming abilities are a non-negotiable need for a sea turtle. The shell was very buoyant in water, and floated on its own. I think however that the biggest flaw with this test was that we don’t know how the material would affect the shell’s buoyancy when attached to a turtle; that is, if it would affect its abilities to dive and navigate underwater (considering how buoyant the shell was on its own).</p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">Eastern Box Turtle Shell Materials Testing</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Finally, after having conducted various force tests on our different shells, we went back to our original Eastern Box Turtle Design and printed it out in PLA, Silk PLA, PETG, and Nylon. We wanted to conduct more materials testing to confirm what would be best for our final reconstruction (and what we would advise others to use in our open source manual).</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We found that the PLA, Silk PLA, and PETG all shattered like egg shells when stomped on. However, the Nylon held up particularly well as it did not break easily, and when it finally did, it only cleanly fractured through (which is mostly just due to the layered nature of 3D printing). This indicated to us that nylon would hold up against the most force and thus be the most protective material for a turtle.</p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">5. Reconstruction</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our final iteration was simulating a shell reconstruction. We chose one of our broken PLA Eastern Box turtle shells that had a rather organic fracture around the rim. By 3D scanning the shell, we were able to obtain a digital reconstruction of the shell. We tried a few different methods of repair. First we used TinkerCAD to add a spherical component on top of the broken fragment.</p>

                            <img class="mb-4" width="300" src="assets/project 7/cad.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We then pivoted to merging an open source file with our scanned component in order to generate an exact fit for the missing part of the shell.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="300" src="assets/project 7/piece.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We then printed this reconstructed piece out in PLA in order to match the material of the bottom broken fragment. After our tests, nylon would be the ideal material, and this is what we would use for an actual client. The reconstructive piece was then hot glued to the broken turtle shell. Some better and more permanent binding materials to use for this would have been bone cement, medically safe glue, or surgical wire if we had access to these. These details also only matter more in regards to an actual turtle client.</p>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Conclusions</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Overall, I would say that each of our iterations taught us about the difference in durability, practicality, and force-resistance of various materials and turtle shells. The data and knowledge we collected was invaluable to repairing a simulated turtle injury and developing an open source guide.</p>
