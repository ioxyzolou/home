                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> My goal this week was to redesign and alter various online 3D print templates on TinkerCAD and Prusa Slicer!</p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Adorned Benchy</h2>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/bad benchy/BB-benchy.png"  alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">My main and most successful print of this project was changing and accessorizing a classic 3D Benchy. I had a lot of fun with this one! Using TinkerCAD, my goals were to increase the size of the Benchy as well as adorn it and adjust its accessories.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/bad benchy/BBB-sketches.png" alt="Benchy Design Sketches" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I mainly used the TinkerCAD app on my iPad for this design, which was a different user experience from the browser version, but I liked the more interactive nature of being able to use touch-screen to make adjustments to the design. I first enlarged the dimensions of my Benchy (which was relatively easy on TinkerCAD) by holding down shift and using the size-adjusting tool. I then wanted to remove the text on the bottom of the boat, add a crown, and adorn it with a ‘B’ monogram on its bow, as well as add other extra elements like lighting bolts.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I found that one of the biggest challenges was aligning the added shapes with the correct plane and angle on the Benchy, as well as removing parts of the Benchy cleanly. It was nearly impossible to do this seamlessly. For example, one adjustment I made was removing the chimney from the top of the Benchy. I did this by creating a cylinder (that was a hole) around the area of the chimney, and then grouping it together with the Benchy. The hole, however, would either create the slightest circular dent either within or protruding from the Benchy. This left ‘scars’ of sorts on the Benchy wherever I removed design features (notice the faint circle in the image below).</p> 
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/bad benchy/BBB-flaws.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I’m sure there’s more sophisticated ways to execute the removal of parts that TinkerCAD’s beginner-friendly style simply cannot cater to. However, this might just be an issue with adjusting a web-downloaded design that cannot be reduced to its original parts.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/bad benchy/BBB-Tinkercad.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For this print, I used most of the default settings. Some changes I made were using 15% honeycomb infill and a detailed layer thickness of 0.10 mm. The total print time was around 7 hours.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/bad benchy/BBB-Print-Settings.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The result of this print was very successful. A detail I noticed was that the honeycomb infill created a very subtle geometric, hexagonal texture on the surface of the Benchy. The only problem I came across was that my print was very stringy, which could have been prevented by lowering the nozzle temperature. Additionally, the tips of the crown were very fragile, and two of them broke off when I tried to clean the stringing. I could have maybe prevented this by increasing the thickness of the crown a bit more.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Overall, this was both a very fun print to design and also a way to develop my skills in adjusting a popular online 3D design, something that seemed out-of-reach in the first few weeks of ENGR 11A when I first started doing 3D prints!</p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Spiral Vases</h2>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/spiral vase/real-spiral-vase.png"  alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> I want to give an honorable mention to the first print that I did before starting this project which was more of a trial run for a long print. I used a free 3D print download for a spiral vase but I didn’t make any actual adjustments to it other than duplicating it and hollowing it out. 
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/spiral vase/spiral-vase-prusa.png" alt=“…”>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In PrusaSlicer I had to set it to Vase Mode in order to hollow the shape out because the STL file did not include that. This mode allowed me to play around with different thicknesses for the vase. I ended up choosing a 3 mm thickness.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="600" src="assets/project 2/spiral vase/vase-mode.png" alt=“…”>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I used pretty standard print settings, leading to a total print time of 6 hours for one vase, and 12 hours for both.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/spiral vase/vase-print-settings.png" alt=“…”>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">My next plan was to adjust this print in order to use it for this project. I wanted to flare the lip of the vase and change its dimensions. I tried to accomplish this on TinkerCAD which, in order to do this, I first had to reduce the file using MeshLab. Then, since TinkerCAD does not have Vase Mode, hollowing the design out was a big challenge. I tried to create an identical shape that was slightly smaller in order to create a hole within the vase; however, because of its spiral shape, aligning the two shapes was particularly difficult (even with the align tool on TinkerCAD). The smaller ‘vase’ (which would create the hole) kept piercing through the outer layer of the vase when I grouped the two together, simply creating an unprintable object. However, this is something after playing around with this more I was able to make some adjustments to the dimensions of the hole and made it work! I also removed a conical piece from the mouth of the vase to turn it into more of a beaker or sorts.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="500" src="assets/project 2/spiral vase/new-vase.png" alt=“…”>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I want to print this next week and see if it turns out any better!</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Elephant Jewelry Dish</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Finally, most recently I embarked on a new 3D printing endeavor of creating a jewelry tray and earring holder from an elephant design I found on Thangs.com.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/elephant tray/elephant-tray-sketches.png" alt=“…”>   
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I created this print in TinkerCAD To create the tray I grouped a circular shape with a hollow cylinder below the elephant. I also added holes into each ear of the elephant to serve as earring holders. I did this by aligning very thin cylinders with the plane of each ear. I simply eyed how even the two holes with each other, but one thing I could improve next time is to find a way to measure the dimensions of alignment of such small holes so that they can be perfectly even with each other.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/elephant tray/elephant_tray-draft-1.png" alt=“…”>  
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For this print I used default print settings with 15% infill. The whole print took around 10 hours.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/elephant tray/elephant-print-settings.png" alt=“…”>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This print miserably failed on the first run. This was very likely because of a fire extinguisher falling over and displacing the strongly magnetized base of the printer, since the print had started out completely fine.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/elephant tray/elephant-tray-major-fail.png" alt=“…”>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After this mess, I started a second print without making any adjustments, but it also failed. This time the issue was more clear, however since the tray printed perfectly but the elephant was completely messed up and lopsided.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/elephant tray/elephant-tray-failed-1.png" alt=“…”>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 2/elephant tray/elephant-tray-failed-2.png" alt=“…”>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I realized that what must have happened was the TinkerCAD design was flawed and the elephant and tray had a gap between them and weren’t grouped together. Thus for my next print I went back into TinkerCAD and adjusted this, making sure they were grouped together for good this time. I also enlarged the tray since from my second print’s results, it seemed too small to hold anything. I did not change the print settings on Prusa.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="500" src="assets/project 2/elephant tray/elephant-tinker-cad.png" alt=“…”>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This 10 hour print is still going and I will update you on the results of it next week!</p>
