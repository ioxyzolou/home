                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The Concept</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For my final project in ENGR 11A, I worked with my peers Greg Roitbourd and Dean Carey, and our goal was to work with an injured turtle and design a prosthesis for a damaged shell using 3D printing and scanning technologies.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The first step in making this project a reality was finding a client. Our ideal customer for this project was a wildlife rescue with a local turtle rescue program that we could work with to be matched with an injured turtle. We imagined a turtle with a damaged shell who needed special treatment and needed to be kept in captivity, however not an animal that needed a high level of medical attention. We needed to be realistic with the level of support we could provide, and any surgical or medical procedures were out of the question. The scope of our reconstructive abilities was defined by any prosthetic device that could be created through 3D printing, scanning, and laser cutting. Making this clear to our potential clients was a priority of ours.</p>
                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Communication</h3>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We began our search by mass-emailing various relevant organizations and rescues with the following template:</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="600" src="assets/project 6/email.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Beyond emailing, our team made a significant effort to find clients through the phone, as this seemed to be a more efficient way to get quicker responses. We made over thirty calls to various vet clinics, rescues, aquariums, and field experts in order to try and secure a client and gain more information on the subject of turtle injuries and rescue efforts.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The most notable and informative clients that our team reached out to were the following: Tufts Cumming School of Veterinary Medicine, Mass Audubon Wildlife Center, New England Wildlife Center, Turtle Rescue League, National Aquarium, and Cicero Moraes (the 1st dude to reconstruct a tortoise’s shell with 3D printing).</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Here’s what we learned from each of them:</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">Tufts Cumming School of Veterinary Medicine</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Professor Boltax was one of the first clients that we reached out to and thus provided us with valuable information in our preliminary client search. Firstly, she was not able to connect us to a client as she informed us that turtle shell injuries are more of a wildlife issue, and it would be challenging to find a client at the veterinary school. Additionally, she brought up that lab rats are difficult to intubate, suggesting the idea of designing a 3D printed rat laryngoscope.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="300" src="assets/project 6/tufts.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">New England Wildlife Center</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This center mainly specializes in birds, so with this client pursuit, we were open to trying a different project, that of beak reconstruction if we could not find a turtle. We were connected to their Cape Cod and Cape Ann locations which often deal with turtles run over by cars as well as with injured sea turtles. Unfortunately this did not lead anywhere.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="200" src="assets/project 6/ne-wildlife.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">Mass Audubon Wildlife Center</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This client seemed promising at first considering that they are the largest wildlife rescue in Massachusetts. However, after some back-and-forth contact, they informed us that none of their turtles in captivity were in need of shell prostheses. They found us a bird client with a broken beak, but this never followed through. From there they just referred us back to the Tufts and the NE Wildlife Center.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="250" src="assets/project 6/mass-audubon.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">National Aquarium</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The National Aquarium was a very promising client at a certain point. I discovered them through an article (https://aqua.org/stories/2021-02-02-introducing-kai) which featured a sea turtle, Kai, who had sustainable shell injuries from a boat. The resulting effects were buoyancy problems, making Kai unable to dive. A research team at the National Aquarium designed a prosthetic to attach to Kai’s shell using similar 3D fabrication methods as us as well as experimenting with different materials. We were very drawn to this established research team that had experience working with this turtle for years. The location of the National Aquarium being in Baltimore presented an issue for us, but we hoped to gain valuable knowledge through remote meetings. Unfortunately, the scheduling for these spanned over too lengthy of a timeline to ever be realized.</p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">Turtle Rescue League</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Turtle Rescue League, which as is implied in its name, works with a plethora of local turtles. They were the only client that actually reached out to schedule a meeting within our timeline. However, what held us back was that we had to drive 2 hours to the rescue, which was not realistically going to permit us to work with a turtle that was so inaccessible to us in-person.</p>
                            <img class="mb-4" width="150" src="assets/project 6/trl.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As stated above, we were unfortunately never able to set up a successful meeting with any of our clients as we kept being ghosted or received highly delayed responses. In fact, before we were able to create a client release for liability, let alone secure a client, we were informed that we were sadly not even legally permitted to work directly with an animal. At that point we had to decide to pivot to developing open source documentation for our project. Our new goal was to simulate a turtle shell injury and develop a process of repair.</p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In order to best understand the issue at hand, we utilized the IBM enterprise design thinking method to sort out exactly how we could achieve the most effective and realistic impact.</p>

                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 6/diagram.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This diagram depicts the needs of a turtle. We deemed that a turtle needs a way to have a shell so that it can comfortably perform everyday actions safely. This overarching action was broken down into three core categories: agility/comfort, safety, and social interaction. Our main conclusions from this were that a turtle needs an intact shell as it contributes to its protective, social, and mobile abilities.</p>

                            <img class="mb-4" width="400" src="assets/project 6/chart.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After identifying the core needs of a turtle, we charted out the feasibility and impact of our ideas. From this plot, we deduced that the most impactful and feasible ideas would be a shell design that fits over their endoskeleton, ideally made of a mud/water resistance material. Additionally scute replacements or partial shell fixes seemed to be a feasible solution.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">From this activity, our team identified that the overarching problem we were aiming to solve was restoring a turtle’s ability to protect and shelter itself.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bolder">Here are the top 5 ways our team came up with ways to come up with a solution to help an injured turtle (ranked in order of most to least realistic):</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">1. 3D print a full prosthetic shell for a turtle with a highly damaged carapace (outer shell layer)</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">2. 3D scan an injured turtle to reconstruct a scute (an individual plate on the turtle shell) or piece of its damaged shell</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">3. Design an adjustable buoyancy weight for a sea turtle</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">4. Combining professional medical assistance like surgical wires and bolts with a 3D printed shell to try to naturally integrate a shell prosthesis onto a turtle</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">5. Create an interchangeable turtle shell prosthetic depending on environment and other conditions</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Once we had a better understanding of the necessary conditions we wanted to meet for helping a turtle, we were ready to create an approachable method of shell reconstruction. In a merging of our top two ideas, simulating a shell injury and using 3D printing and scanning to fix it seemed to be the most feasible and impactful option.
